# next_shift

**TASK:**
Write a program to check if I have a shift on a certain day.

**PREREQUISITES:**
only basic python libraries.

**SOLUTION:**

The program works with the datetime or calendar library, through the simple menu takes the data and print the result. Its used to calculate the following shifts in my current work. Program will ask when I have my next day-shift and then the year, month and day when I want to know how my shifts are going. At the same time, it will offer a list of all shifts until March of the following year (due to the fact that shifts change in March every year).

**NOTE:**

One of my first ones on which I tried working with my own functions, cycles, if/else and file reading.
